## Lab Configs

Please note that 192.168.10.0/24 is one of my lab management networks and has no relevance to the lab other than that.

I have enabled services gRPC and access to MQTT for other purposes and left the configuration in place.

P1 has configuration for a "Central services VPN" where my operational tests come from which is called "111" after the customer number that we're using.

Other than these specifics, you should be good to download the specific versions and re-create the labs!
